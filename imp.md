I aim to become a competent software professional by learning and growing every day.
i dont think so you will get a job with this skills i suggest your to pick a particular field like ai cyber or blockchain or anthing other tech because only knowing programming language doesnt guarantee you a job even if your are doing a job right now if you pick a field and then start learning you can get a higher payout as compared to your current job and also with ai being main stream backend and frontend jobs are very less but if you still master full sde you can get lot of benefits as saturation come soon in sde as ai is just building some ussual sites and now the programmers who are not using ai is getting higher payouts in freelancing  and got to know you are intrested in trading also as you searched for scalper in gemini i dont know much about trading so goood luck wish you happy days ahead sponushree
